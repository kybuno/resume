**INTERESTS**

In my free time, I enjoy gaming, reading, and drawing. I've learnt how to crochet, knit and embroider, creating handmade gifts for my loved ones. After my A-levels, I also built a PC in an attempt to save money (and it still works!) I find joy in creating and love taking on the challenge of picking up new skills. I've recently learnt the basics of 3D modelling in blender and hope to make even more in this new medium.

**PROFILE**

As a second-year student pursuing a degree in Computing and Law, I am excited to embark on a journey of discovery and growth. With a keen interest in both technology and legal studies, I am eager to explore how these disciplines intersect and complement each other. Outside of academics, I find joy in artistic expression and enjoy creating new things, be it art or otherwise. I am enthusiastic about learning and honing my skills, and I look forward to gaining hands-on experience and contributing positively to future endeavors
